<description>## Invalid Alembic ROP Face Sets

When groups are saved as Face Sets with the Alembic these show up
as shadingEngine connections in Maya - however, with animated groups
these connections in Maya won't work as expected, it won't update per
frame. Additionally, it can break shader assignments in some cases
where it requires to first break this connection to allow a shader to
be assigned.

It is allowed to include Face Sets, so only an issue is logged to
identify that it could introduce issues down the pipeline.
