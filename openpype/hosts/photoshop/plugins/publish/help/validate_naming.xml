## Invalid name of subset

Name of subset is created from a layer name. Some characters (whitespace, '/' etc.) are not allowed because of publishing (files couldn't be saved on some OSes).

### How to repair?

You can fix this with `Repair` button on the right. This will remove invalid characters with safe character ('_' by default) in both subset names and matching group names.

After that restart `Publish` with a `Reload button`.

Or you use `Subset Manager` to delete existing subsets, remove created groups, rename layers that are used for their creation and use `Create` option in the Openpype menu to create them again.

Invalid characters and 'safe character' could be configured in Settings. Ask your OpenPype admin to modify them if necessary.
